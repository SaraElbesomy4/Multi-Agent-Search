This is my final project for the Artificial Intelligence course (CIE 458) in UST - Zewail City. This is project is prepared by UC Berkeley, as part of their course CS 188. In this project I implemented some of AI search algorithms such as minimax , Alpha &amp; Beta and expectimax search and try to designing my evaluation function in a simulation for Pacman game.
